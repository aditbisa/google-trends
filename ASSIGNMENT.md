## Data Collection TTA

As a data engineer, you are required to acquire and manipulate data. 

Provide a script to collect Google Trends weekly, daily and hourly data with the keyword ‘bitcoin’ since 2015-01-01 and save results in csv or json file. Write as much actual program code as you can in any programming language (Node.js or Python is preferred). You are also welcomed to use pseudo code to illustrate how you want to tackle the TECH ASSESSMENT if you find it more illustrative of your capability.

Nevertheless, you must provide a README that includes but not limited to 

1. describing your idea, 
2. the amount of time you spent on finishing the program code (or pseudo code), 
3. the different ways you have tried to approach the TECH ASSESSMENT, 
4. the reasons of settling on the current approach, and finally, 
5. how to execute your program.

You may use your preferred language (i.e. Chinese or English) to write the README.
